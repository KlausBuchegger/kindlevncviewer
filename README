This is a VNC viewer for e-book devices
Copyright (c) 2011 Hans-Werner Hilse <hilse@web.de>

It works on the framebuffer, using the einkfb API from e-ink devices (einkfb.h) to do screen refreshs.
This is based on LibVNCclient (part of the LibVNCserver project, see http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/.


There's a discussion thread at
http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=150434


Configuration:
--------------

There are a few hard-compiled config items. See the #define statements in kindlevncviewer.c
Most notable is the "endless reconnect" feature. It will try to make a new connection to the VNC server if the old connection died. This seems to be needed on the author's Kindle DX as the device will kill TCP connections after a while.


Building:
---------

It is suggested to compile LibVNCclient in a very minimal version. Personally, I use the following call to configure:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/hw/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/sys-root/usr/lib/pkgconfig/ \
    ./configure --without-gcrypt --without-client-gcrypt \
                --without-gnutls --without-client-tls \
                --without-ipv6 --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi \
                 --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi \
                --prefix=/home/hw/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/sys-root/usr/

LibVNCclient will have dependencies on libjpeg and libz in this case.
Of course, you will have to alter that to read path names that point to your own cross toolchain.

In order to build kindlevncviewer, you should just edit the Makefile, adapt it to your toolchain name and path, and then just issue

    make

and it should build an executable.


Running:
--------

You need to copy the program and the libraries it needs (you can just try running it without and it will show you which libraries are missing) onto your ebook device. Then call (from a launcher app or a shell)

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. kindlevncviewer 192.168.2.1:1

(you will need to put in the correct server address or name and screen number).

With the source code, a shell script is provided that will do the setup of LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly (kvncviewer.sh).
Also, a config file for the "launchpad" application on Kindle is provided which makes use of the shell script.
